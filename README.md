Offline tool for creating and taking tests.

## About

Mionly is a project that aims to simplify the learning process for teachers by providing the ability to create tests in a few clicks and share that test between multiple computers by simply transferring the created file.

Currently, Mionly only provides a test taking feature for the computer on which the test is hosted. The student test taking feature will be available in the future.
